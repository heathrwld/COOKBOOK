                    <h2>Fish and Chips</h2>
                    <p>
                      Fish and chips is a hot dish consisting of fried fish in batter, served with chips. The dish originated in England, 
                                          where these two components had been introduced from separate immigrant cultures; it is not known who combined them. 
                                          Often considered Britain's national dish, 
                                          fish and chips is a common takeaway food in numerous other countries, particularly English-speaking and Commonwealth nations.

                        Set aside 2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. In a large, roomy bowl, mix the remaining 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour with 7 tablespoons cornstarch and 1 teaspoon baking powder. Season lightly with a tiny pinch of fine salt and freshly ground black pepper.

                        Using a fork to whisk continuously, add 1/3 cup cold dark beer and 1/3 cup cold sparkling water to the flour mixture and continue mixing until you have a thick, smooth batter. Place the batter in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes to 1 hour.                </p>

                        Meanwhile, cut 2-pounds peeled potatoes into a little less than 1/2-inch-thick slices, then slice these into 1/2-inch-wide sticks. Place the chips into a colander and rinse under cold water.              </div>

                        Place the washed chips into a saucepan of enough cold water to cover them by about 1 inch. Bring to a gentle boil over high heat, then simmer on low heat for 3 to 4 minutes.              </div>

                        Heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil to 350 F in a deep-fryer or large, deep saucepan. Par-cook the chips a few handfuls at a time in the oil, about 2 minutes (do not brown them). Remove the chips from the oil and drain on paper towels. Set aside.              </div>

                        Position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 200 F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels and set aside. Bring the oil temperature back to 350 F.
